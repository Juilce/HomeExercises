                <p>Where am I going? How long have I got?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... 
                    like tears in rain... Time to die.</p>
                <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life.
